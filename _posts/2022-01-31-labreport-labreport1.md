# Reflection on Lab 1

I found this process to be relatively straightforward, albeit frustrating at times where I could not do exactly what I wanted on my site. 
I've always found the process of creating a website somewhat intimidating, but the GitHub interface and the explicit instructions made the 
process very approachable. I think the most frustration I encountered was in the process of forking the theme that I wanted. Ultimately, my
first choice, second choice, and third choice themes simply were not working for me, and I had to choose something that I was not particularly
excited about. Not having the technical skills to troubleshoot the issues with the theme or even adjust things I don't like on the one I
have gone with is frustrating, but ultimately I hope to gain those skills in time to make my website more personalized. 

After going through the steps to set up my site, I did encounter some issues as I attempted my first post. I worked on this outside of class
after forking a new theme and some of the tiny details that are essential to successfully posting escaped me while I was on my own. Not only did 
I forget the .md at the end of my post name, but I also miss entered the date. At first the post simply did not show up, and then I got a very 
aggressive looking error message. Luckily, the error messages on GitHub are quite detailed and let you know exactly where in the process the post 
went wrong. I was able to fix the date on the post and have it successfully show up on my actual site. The final step in this process, successfully
writing in Markdown has been an interesting experiment. It has been quite a bit of trial and error, adjusting formatting to see what the effect will be.
(An earlier version of this post had the text in a strange scrolling box, and I still don't quite know how that came about.)

# My Goals for This Semester

I have a few goals for this course, but the primary one is to become comfortable and literate in the tech we are working with. I want to be
able to transfer the skills I gain in this course to other projects, and to do so I need to understand how to use these tools outside of the
context of the classroom. I really want to get to know these skills so I can properly have them in my arsenal going forward, rather than 
only understand how to work with them in a controlled environment. I also want to be able to use this knowledge, of coding and data, to better
understand other projects that I use. There has been a surge of DH projects in the field of Early Modern studies, and having this background 
knowledge will help me to understand the work that has already been done. I would like to be able to look at project like [RECRIC]:https://recirc.nuigalway.ie/
and understand some of the digital methodology behind it.
