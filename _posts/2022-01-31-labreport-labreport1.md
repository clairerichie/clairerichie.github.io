# Reflection on Lab 1
    I found this process to be relatively straightforward, albeit frustrating at times where I could not do exactly what I wanted on my site. 
I've always found the process of creating a website somewhat intimidating, but the GitHub interface and the explicit instructions made the 
process very approachable. I think the most frustration I encountered was in the process of forking the theme that I wanted. Ultimately, my
first choice, second choice, and third choice themes simply were not working for me, and I had to choose something that I was not particularly
excited about. Not having the technical skills to troubleshoot the issues with the theme or even adjust things I don't like on the one I
have gone with is frustrating, but ultimately I hope to gain those skills in time to make my website more personalized. 
    After going through the steps to set up my site, I did encounter some issues as I attempted my first post. I worked on this outside of class
after forking a new theme and some of the tiny details that are essential to successfully posting escaped me while I was on my own. Not only did 
I forget the .md at the end of my post name, but I also miss entered the date. At first the post simply did not show up, and then I got a very 
aggressive looking error message. Luckily, the error messages on GitHub are quite detailed and let you know exactly where in the process the post 
went wrong. I was able to fix the date on the post and have it successfully show up on my actual site.
