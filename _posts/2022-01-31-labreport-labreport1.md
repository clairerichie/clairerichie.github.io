## Reflection on Lab 1

I found this process to be relatively straightforward, albeit frustrating at times where I could not do exactly what I wanted on my site. 
I've always found the process of creating a website somewhat intimidating, but the GitHub interface and the explicit instructions made the 
process very approachable. I think the most frustration I encountered was in the process of forking the theme that I wanted. Ultimately, my
first choice, second choice, and third choice themes simply were not working for me, and I had to choose something that I was not particularly
excited about. Not having the technical skills to troubleshoot the issues with the theme or even adjust things I don't like on the one I
have gone with is frustrating, but ultimately I hope to gain those skills in time to make my website more personalized. 

After going through the steps to set up my site, I did encounter some issues as I attempted my first post. I worked on this outside of class
after forking a new theme and some of the tiny details that are essential to successfully posting escaped me while I was on my own. Not only did 
I forget the .md at the end of my post name, but I also miss entered the date. At first the post simply did not show up, and then I got a very 
aggressive looking error message. Luckily, the error messages on GitHub are quite detailed and let you know exactly where in the process the post 
went wrong. I was able to fix the date on the post and have it successfully show up on my actual site. The final step in this process, successfully
writing in Markdown has been an interesting experiment. It has been quite a bit of trial and error, adjusting formatting to see what the effect will be.
(An earlier version of this post had the text in a strange scrolling box, and I still don't quite know how that came about.)

## My Goals for This Semester

I have a few goals for this course, but the primary one is to become comfortable and literate in the tech we are working with. I want to be
able to transfer the skills I gain in this course to other projects, and to do so I need to understand how to use these tools outside of the
context of the classroom. I really want to get to know these skills so I can properly have them in my arsenal going forward, rather than 
only understand how to work with them in a controlled environment. I also want to be able to use this knowledge, of coding and data, to better
understand other projects that I use. There has been a surge of DH projects in the field of Early Modern studies, and having this background 
knowledge will help me to understand the work that has already been done. I would like to be able to look at project like [RECIRC](https://recirc.nuigalway.ie/)
and understand some of the digital methodology behind it.

Apart from a bit of digital literacy, I would like to make some serious headway on the DH project on which I am currently collaborating with Kate Albrecht
and Katie Sanford. We have a pretty decent Wordpress site with integrated CSVs currently up, but I would like to take that further both aesthetically and 
practically. Our dataset, early modern print and manuscript works by women, is extensive and still incomplete. I want to continue adding to that dataset
and start seriously thinking about everything our data can do. I want to start thinking about visualizations, processing, and otherwise putting our
data to work for us. I think this course can really help us answer not only what our data can do for us, but what we can do for our data. One of my primary
motivations in working on this project was increasing access to information like this. Incredible resources like Early English Books Online (EEBO) and digitized
manuscript collections at institutions like the Folger Shakespeare Library has already increased our knowledge about early modern women's writing, but there
are not as many tools that actually make accessible the raw information all in one place. Something I have been thinking about since the Digital Humanities
Research Institute has been audience. We have envisioned a primarily scholarly audience with a secondary focus on the general public, but we have not really
talked through the differing needs of those audiences. To what extent will each of those audiences be utilizing our data and for what purpose? How can we best
set up our data to meet those needs? Providing access to this information is certainly a priority, but the organization of the data is equally important for
the varying audiences we have.

Finally, pedagogy is something I have been thinking more about lately, being surrounded by the really passionate educators in our PhD program. My personal
style has a tendency to be stuck in the past, but I have been pressed to update my technology usage by my undergraduate students, even if that just looks
like using more digital tools in the classroom over the whiteboard. Not only would I eventually like to be able to impart some basic skills, or at least the
option to work with digital humanities tools on my students, but I am considering how students might get involved in DH projects. Using resources like 
[The Pulter Project](https://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/) and [EMROC](https://emroc.hypotheses.org/) as examples, I want to consider ways that undergraduate 
and graduate students might contribute to our project. Being active participants in a project that is making real headway in the field might just help students 
engage with older material as much as the modern.
